I am currently engaged in a bootcamp tutorial focused on web development 💻, where I am learning to create a website 🌐 utilizing technologies such as React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and Jest. 

In addition, I am also developing a food ordering application 🍔 using the same tech stack, allowing me to apply my skills in a practical context while enhancing my understanding of modern web development frameworks and tools 🚀.
